# Nhut Vo's Github Data Portfolio - The-Analyst-Job-Dataset  

## **Executive Summary:**

Hello datafam,

This data analytics github porfolio is based on real world data found from the job market. I've gathered various job listings from different job board websites like LinkedIn, Indeed, WorkInTexas, and much more sites. Compiling the data found into SQL format, I've created a database with three tables featuring all the data from the job market. These datas are my findings that should help job seeker navigate the job market. I hope to share my insights with both employers and employees. 

* Collected real world data and transformed them into meaningful insights
* Used key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the performance of our organization
* Analyzed clean data to solve business problems and point out key insights best for business decision
* Turned data into tables, charts, graphs, and dashboards to share with stakeholders my data visualization findings

## **Business Problem:**

Employers and job seekers are having a difficult time finding the right match for each other. Imagine the job market is like using a dating app, two potential partners are trying to find the perfect match for each other. As an analyst, we must find insight in the data that both sides needs from each other. One side needs employees, while the other side needs an employer, but both parties must find chemistry from the other to have a successful business impact.

## **Methodology:**

1. Top SQL skills job seekers should have for the analytics job market.
