# Analyst-Job-Dataset

Hello everyone,

This data analytics github porfolio is based on real world data found from the job market. I've gathered various job listings from different job board websites like LinkedIn, Indeed, WorkInTexas, and much more sites. Compiling the data found into SQL format, I've created a database with three tables featuring all the data from the job market. These datas are my findings that should help job seeker navigate the job market. I hope to share my insights with both employers and employees.
